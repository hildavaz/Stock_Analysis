# Stock_Analysis

## Project Overview
Performing Analysis on Stock Data for green energy to help Steve if  is a good investment for his first clients
His clients want to invest all their funds into DQ Green Energy Stocks.  They do not know anything about Green Energy Stocks, therefor I have helped Stive with an analysis for a handful of Green Energy Stocks to help his clients with a better chose.

## Stock Analysis Resutls
As it shows on the imagines below the Green Energy Stocks heave a large percentage return decrease from 2017 to 2018. Based on the Analysis results DQ is not a good Ticker investment, however there are EMPH and JKS Green Energy Stocks investments that could have good returns.  Also, the investment funds have better returns these are invested into multiple Stocks and not only one.
