# Stock_Analysis

## Project Overview

Performing Analysis on Stock Data for green energy to help Steve if  is a good investment for his first clients
His clients want to invest all their funds into DQ Green Energy Stocks.  They do not know anything about Green Energy Stocks, therefor I have helped Stive with an analysis for a handful of Green Energy Stocks to help his clients with a better chose.

## Stock Analysis Resutls

As it shows on the imagines below the Green Energy Stocks heave a large percentage return decrease from 2017 to 2018. Based on the Analysis results DQ is not a good Ticker investment, however there are EMPH and JKS Green Energy Stocks investments that could have good returns.  Also, the investment funds have better returns these are invested into multiple Stocks and not only one.
Performing this analysis by creating a code was successful however, refactoring the code was helpful with a better performance.

## Summary 

The advantages of refactoring the code will help find discrepancies within the code, it helps with performance, and it would be easy to understand in in the future. Tells its story better. The disadvantage is that it can take a big amount of time to do so.

The advantage of refactoring with the VBA script was that all the steps were already in it, therefor I was aware of the changes needed.  This will make it easy for Steve to read it and make any updates. A disadvantage it was time consuming.
